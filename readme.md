## Overview

**ptracer** is a raytracer written in *rust*. It is a work in progress.

## Current functionality

- raytracing spheres
- camera move
- directional lihgt source
- two types of material

## Nearest plans:

- replace spheress with meshes
- add support for a 3d file format
- add support for more light sources
- vectorize computation
- implement proper game-like main loop
- add more controls (bax bounces, rays per pixel)
