+ draw a buffer on a canvas
+ raytrace a sphere with just constant color
+ bounce off the ray to the light source
+ optimize vector division: return (1/t) * v;
+ fix drawing a sphere twice (before and behind the camera)
+ organize code
+ let camera just span rays, and scene do the rest
+ fix coloured shadow
+ introduce multisampling
- optimize using random generator
- add triangles
- add support for a 3d scene format
- add light sources
